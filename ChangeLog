Kobo Deluxe v0.4pre8
	* Added Extreme Pickyness Mode (--enable-epm).
	  (Unfortunately, this is not enough to ensure that
	  stuff compiles on gcc 3.x. Guess I'll just have to
	  install gcc3, or rely on gcc3 users reporting all
	  warnings and errors.)
	* Some const string issues fixed. (Returning a const
	  string as "char *" and the like.)
	* Removed all AdLib stuff and support for non-
	  standard MIDI file variants. However cool it might
	  be to play those files, I have no use for it and
	  can't maintain it in this project.
	* Removed old bogus stuff from the comments in
	  filemap.h.
	* Minor cleanups in filemap.cpp.
	* Some GCC3 fixes in score.cpp. (String copying...)
	* Scroll text updated.
	* Improved scroller "speed throttling".
	* Returning to the intro now restores the "demo" map.
	* Added Electric Fence to the Extreme Pickyness Mode.
	* Started cleaning up the C code using Splint. (Can
	  someone please donate a FlexLint license...? :-)
	* load_sounds() in kobo.cpp fixed; it wouldn't load
	  the music if the sound effects were loaded with
	  a previous call.
	* Somewhere along the way, I managed to get the
	  intro to generate a new demo map on every intro
	  screen switch. Fixed.
	* Audio engine changes:
		* Added OSS 'pollaudio' for debugging.
		* Fixed index outside array in
		  audio_wave_free()!
		* Tightened up the API - signs only where
		  needed and things like that.
		* 0 dB peak amplitude for 32 bit waveforms
		  changed to [-1.0, +1.0].
		* ptab_init() now takes an integer argument.
		  (No implicit float->fixp16:16 conversion.)
		* Ports and "clients" are now named for
		  debugging/tracing, although client names
		  exist only if AEV_TRACING is compiled in.
		* Cleaned up audio event system names.
		  Everything is now aev_<something>, and most
		  names have been significantly shortened.
		* Added aev_init() macro for ports! (Aargh!)
		* Open/close of subsystems cleaned up. All
		  subsystems now have audio_*_open/close()
		  calls, and should (hopefully) clean up
		  properly when closed.
		* Audio engine open/close API changed;
		  the full sequence is now:
			audio_open()	(optional)
			audio_start()
			audio_stop()	(optional)
			audio_close()
		  Note that the waveform and scripting
		  subsystems will still initialize
		  themselves automatically if used before
		  calling audio_open().
		! The last two seem to have fixed the
		  issues with restarting the engine on
		  Linux! Remains to see if that was the
		  whole problem...
	BENCHMARK:	speed1.agw renders in 27.2 s.
			speed2.agw renders in 21.5 s.
			Total: 48.7 s.
		* Added block based processing framework.
		* Implemented block read, write and add.
		* Added block based envelope processing.
		* Using the new envelope interface - but
		  still processing one sample at a time.
	(BENCHMARK:	speed.agw renders in 34.2 s!)
		* Using 32 frame blocks in wca_filter()
		  and wca_gain().
	(BENCHMARK:	speed.agw renders in 33.6 s.
			wca_filter() disabled: 31 s.)
		* Converted wca_osc() to block based
		  processing, and made some minor
		  optimizations.
		* WCA_SYNC for WCA_NOISE fixed. Each sync
		  pulse now shifts in a new value through
		  the S&H as well.
		* Fixed bug in spectrum oscillators: They
		  would produce no output with a mod1 input
		  of less than 1.0. They now produce pure
		  sine, as originally intended.
		* HSPECTRUM and PHSPECTRUM fixed: They
		  actually didn't separate roll-off control
		  for odd and even harmonics at all! (Thus,
		  they were basically just broken versions
		  of SPECTRUM...)
		* SPECTRUM modulation mapping unified; MOD1
		  now always controls the overtone stepping.
		* The new AHSPECTRUM replaces PHSPECTRUM.
		* HSPECTRUM becomes a AHSPECTRUM with
		  multiplicative overtone stepping control.
	BENCHMARK:	speed1.agw:	10.2 s. 167% faster.
			speed2.agw:	17.7 s. 21% faster.
			Total: 27.9 s. 75% faster.
		Obviously, the optimizations worked out
		rather well. Next, we'll try to do something
		about those spectrum oscillators...		

Kobo Deluxe v0.4pre7
	* Old samples boosted by 70%, to compensate for the
	  lack of an illogical amplification factor in the
	  new engine. :-)
	* The screwed up scroll position during the "Game
	  Over" state fixed.
	* "Early bullets", flickering and other crap fixed.
	* gfxengine_t and sprite.[ch]: Added clampcolor() and
	  s_clampcolor (for specifying what color and alpha
	  to assume for areas outside images), and changed
	  the color format to Uint8 in the range [0,255], to
	  be consistent with the change in window_t.
	* manage: Selecting a starting stage before staring
	  a game now preserves the actual map that is
	  generated. You don't get a new version of the
	  same level, but the exact map you're looking at
	  before starting the game.
	* radar: Fixed potential color allocation bug when
	  changing video mode; it used to initialize only
	  once during the game life time...
	* radar: Tweaked colors, and made the the blue
	  launcher nodes visible on the radar.
	* Options 'cheat' and 'indicator' are now commands
	  rather than switches, so they cannot be saved in
	  the configuration by accident.
	* Split the "push move" mode off from 'indicator'
	  into a feature of it's own, activated with
	  the 'pushmove' command.
	* Game and Control options moved to the top of the
	  options main menu.
	* Scrolling radar implemented. Can be disabled in
	  Game Options, to work like the old version.
	* gfxengine_t make slightly more robust WRT calls
	  being made while the screen is closed.
	* Switching between fullscreen and windowed modes
	  can now be done at any time with the usual ALT+ENTER
	  shortcut. :-) Special case activates pause mode if
	  it's done in the middle of a game.
	* Random number generator split in two; pubrand and
	  gamerand, and get_seed() member added, as a
	  preparation for demo recording and playback.
	* 'P' and the mighty strange Pause Key parsed and
	  routed to the pause function. (This is also used
	  internally, as a neat way of telling whatever state
	  might be active to pause.)
	* Touched up the screen framework artwork a little.
	* Optimized background rendering some. (Occasional
	  clipped extra row and column of tiles eliminated.)
	* Stupid bug in window_t::invalidate() found and
	  killed: gfxengine_t clips invalidated rects, so we
	  need to make sure our window is selected!
	* window_t now supports background images. clear()
	  takes an optional SDL_Rect, and blits from the
	  image, if there is one, or fills with the
	  background color as in previous versions.)
	* Background graphics in the displays and the radar
	  screen! :-)
	* Added dither plugin with hard-coded 2x2 filter.
	* Added options to turn dithering off.
	* Added kludge for OpenGL cards that can't handle
	  RGBA8, but turns it into RGBA4, and a switch to
	  enable it if required.
	* sprite: S_BLITMODE_NORMAL renamed S_BLITMODE_AUTO.
	  (Makes more sense!)
	* Option broken_numdia (Broken NumPad Diagonals)
	  added - I want to use the page up/down keys for
	  other stuff, even if *some* systems can't decode
	  the numpad correctly! :-/
	* Added the algorithmically constructed sound
	  effect "SOUND_LAUNCH".
	* Separated the AGW scripting engine core from the
	  audio engine and made it the "Extensible Embeddable
	  Language". (a_agw.[ch] now contain only the AGW
	  extension to EEL.)
	* Added the algorithmically constructed sound
	  effect "SOUND_LAUNCH2", for the "blue balls".
	* Fixed some bugs in filemapper_t.
	* Any jerking, flickering etc when entering a new
	  stage should now be *completely* eliminated. I
	  think... ;-)
	* Intro doesn't conflict with stage 100 any more.
	* Implemented 2D positional sound effects. :-)
	* Added screenshot feature. (OpenGL not implemented,
	  as the current glSDL cannot read the screen surface.)
	  Saves BMP only, and is connected to PrintScreen and
	  SysReq.
	* EEL now uses the same callback prototype for all
	  extensions, whether they are commands, operators
	  or functions.
	* Ported Jeremy Sheeley's player profiles patch
	  from 0.3, and tweaked the user interface a little.
	* Fixed double initialization of the manage object.
	* Extended the score file format into a more powerful,
	  versionned "profile file format".
	* file.(h|cpp) and parts of score.(h|cpp) replaced
	  with pfile.(h|cpp), which implements a generic,
	  portable "toolkit" for platform independent binary
	  data file access.
	* Added game.(h|cpp), which collects all configurable
	  game parameters in one place.
	* The "speed" parameter is now considered a cheat,
	  and is no more available from within the game.
	* Last player profile is remembered in the config.
	* Added optional "Diagonals Emphasis Filter". (I'd
	  say it only makes control feel sluggish most of the
	  time, but it might work for someone... I'm open to
	  suggestions if anyone has an idea for a smarter
	  filter.)
	* Eliminated extra calls to score_manager_t::record().
	* Start level selection in intro mode removed.
	* Implemented collision/health system. When two
	  "collidable" objects collide, the damage of each
	  object is subtracted from the health of the other.
	  (Object properties set so that the game will
	  play exactly like the original with the single
	  player default settings for the player ship.)
	* Turned the "shield = -1" feature into 'shootable'.
	* Added health bar.
	* Threw in detection and fix to read broken 73 byte
	  scorefiles from older Win32 versions. (Seems like
	  the new code works right on Win32 as well, BTW.)
	* Various fixes and additions to filemapper_t.
	  (Scanning multiple directories, most importantly.)
	* Removed "./scores" from the SCORES path for now,
	  as it's actually the same place as the default
	  score dir on Win32. (You'd get all profiles and
	  scores twice, that is.)
	* Removed "bgm.raw" as it's not used anymore.
	* No hyphen before the "pre" from now on!
	* glSDL changes:
		* Applications can now set the colorkey of
		  of surface *after* SDL_DisplayFormat() -
		  although it will just discard the TexInfo,
		  resulting in the surface being converted
		  before the first blit, and after every
		  change in the surface.
		* Silly intermediate buffer eliminated in
		  _DownloadTexture().
		* glSDL automatically stretches resolutions
		  below 640x480 using an integer factor.
	* Audio engine changes:
		* Benchmarking tries to use gettimeofday() if
		  not compiled for x86 CPUs.
		* a_tools.h got some cleaning up, some new
		  macros, and mixing functions optimized with
		  a Duff's Device variant.
		* __mastervol() is obsoleted by the groups,
		  and was killed to save some cycles. (It ate
		  almost 1% of my P-III 933!)
		* Ditched the "Smart Stereo" Limiter - it's
		  not loud enough, and should be replaced with
		  something that drives the signal non-linear
		  to squeeze more power in when the signal
		  isn't panned center.
		* Dropped the saturating 32->16 bit converter,
		  and fixed the limiter so that it reliably
		  *limits* the signal the way it should.
		* Limiter does no longer invert the signal.
		* Added ACC_PRIORITY.
		* Added controls for Channel Inserts.
		* Channel default controls (used in DETACH
		  mode) removed. Just expect channel controls
		  to stay where you leave them, and
		  everything should be fine - and faster!
		* Implemented dynamic voice allocation.
		* ACC_DETACH now effectively means
		  "polyphonic mode". "Detached" voices are
		  still owned by the channel that launched
		  them - but just as before, channel
		  controls don't affect voices directly after
		  they're launched. (Even that may change
		  eventually...)
		* Ripped mid.cpp and mid.h from the AdLib FM
		  player AdPlug 1.1. Started stripping off
		  the FM stuff and converting it to C and the
		  "midisock" interface.
		* Added primitive VU-meter to the voice mixer.
		* Implemented audio_wave_convert(), using the
		  voice mixer in interpolated 16x oversampled
		  mode.
		* Added simple enhancer and noise gate
		  functions to the init time wave API.
		* Hacked basic polyphony support into a_midicon.
		* ACC_RANDTRIG is now *really* a 16:16 fixp
		  value, to allow finer control of the
		  randomize depth. (Next, I'll make the section
		  end marker fixed point, to allow sub sample
		  accurate loop timing - as well as finer
		  RETRIG and RANDTRIG control. :-)
		* Fabricated a nice 3'rd degree LUT for
		  various MIDI -> Linear Control mapping.
		* Introduced a more solid scheme for keeping
		  track of allocated voices.
		* audio_channel_play() now takes 16:16 linear
		  pitch and 16:16 volume, instead of the bogus
		  MIDI format arguments.
		* Added audio_wave_filter().
		* DETACH mode split into ADM_POLY and
		  ADM_FULL, to natively support the slightly
		  different ways DETACH mode is used by
		  midicon and for sound effects.
		* Added cubic (4-point) interpolation, based
		  on a formula by Olli Niemitalo. Low freq
		  sines sound *perfect* - no audible distortion
		  whatsoever. It sounds great up to 1:1, but
		  runs into trouble in the upper half of the
		  octave above 1:1 - linear 2X+ sounds better
		  from there and up. The best part is that the
		  CPU usage is somewhere in between linear 2X
		  and linear 4X on a P-III.
		* Volume ramping bug fixed: The "boot strap"
		  values calculated when starting new voices
		  were wrong, and resulted in an undesired
		  fade in over one buffer.
		* "Playing" indicator below the per-voice VUs.
		* Waveform size restrictions eliminated! (Well,
		  you'd probably have trouble with 2+ GB on 32
		  bit systems... ;-)
		* Dynamic voice allocation now always starts
		  with voice 0 in the first pass, when looking
		  for unused voices. (The other passes are still
		  starting at the voice after the last voice
		  allocated, to favor the "oldest" voice when
		  there are multiple equivalent choices.)
		* Implemented MIDI CCs 120, 121, 123, 126 & 127.
		* Added SILENT and RESTING states to the plugin
		  API, to deal with silent output efficiently.
		* Optimized bus handling; now, bus send buffer
		  clearing and other stuff isn't even considered
		  unless a bus actually is in use.
		* Implemented the Bus Control MIDI CCs. (39...55
		  on the first AUDIO_MAX_BUSSES channels.)
		* Reverb SNR improved. The internal precision is
		  now 8 bits higher than that of the I/O, which
		  produces "perfect" results down to the LSB in
		  the final output.
		* Implemented CCs 88, 89 and 91; "primary bus",
		  "send bus" and "send level".
		* Added SINEMORPH, SPECTRUM, and LSPECTRUM
		  oscillators.
		* Changed ACC_PITCH to fixed point linear freq,
		  where the integer bits correspond to MIDI
		  pitch. That is, 60.0 now does what 1.0 used
		  to do, and to step up one octave, add 12.0
		  instead of multiplying by 2.0.
		* Various oscillators and stuff added to the
		  Waveform Construction API.
		* Added bandlimiting or oversampling to all
		  Waveform Construction API oscillators.
		* Modulation API cleaned up.
		* Voice mixer code cleaned up a bit.
		* Voices now use timestamped events for control.
		* "Plugin style" API for patches separates the
		  channel->voice bindings from the engine core.
	    BENCHMARKING NOTE: Right now it takes 60 seconds to
		load and render the 72 AGW sounds I've created
		so far. Although most of the code is currently
		*very* inefficient, only the SPECTRUM oscillators
		are really so slow that it matters.
	* Audio Voice Mixer benchmark results, 20020111:
	   (P-III 933, 48 kHz, 20 ms latency, playing
	   an 8 kHz 8 bit stereo sample in 32 voices,
	   compiler optimizations disabled. Unit is percent
	   of total CPU time.)
	   -----------------------------------------------
		Very Low:	6.9%
		Low:		14.5%
		Normal:		10.1%
		High:		17.9%
		Very High:	136% (overload!)

	   (Same, but with gcc/g++ -O3 optimization.)
	   -----------------------------------------------
		Very Low:	3.5%
		Low:		6.5%
		Normal:		4.6%
		High:		7.9%
		Very High:	78% (causes underruns)

	   Obviously, on this machine, the "Normal" mode,
	   which is using plain linear interpolation, is
	   almost as fast as the "Very Low" mode, whereas
	   the "Low" mode is more expensive. This is to be
	   expected from CPUs with fast multiplications.
	* Audio Voice Mixer benchmark results, 20020503:
	   (Same machine, same settings, same test, but with
	   the new cubic interpolating mixer, internal
	   fragment size limit, timestamped events etc. With
	   -O3 optimizations.)
	   -----------------------------------------------
		Very Low:	4.5%
		Low:		6.8%
		Normal:		5.5%
		High:		8.2%
		Very High:	9.5%

	  Higher loads occur only when pushing the pitch more
	  than ~1.5 octaves above fs in "Very High" quality.
	  (That results in linear interpolation w/ 4x+
	  oversampling, which is pretty slow.)


*** The Audio Engine: Why the GPLed files?

    The sound code used in Kobo Deluxe was originally written
    by Masanao Izumo <mo@goice.co.jp>, for XKobo 1.11+.
    Masanao also added the sound effect samples that are still
    being used.

    You may have noticed that, while most, if not all of the
    current audio engine is new code, which is LGPLed, a few
    files (a_globals.[ch] and audio.[ch]) are GPLed, and
    contain a copyright notice mentioning Masanao Izumo.
    
    This effectively means that the whole audio engine has
    to be used under the terms of the GPL; not the LGPL.

    As this will probably be too restrective for many of the
    users the engine is targetting, I've contacted Masanao
    for a resolution, but have yet to receive a response.

Kobo Deluxe v0.4-pre6
	* I've compiled with -Wall and nearly all of the
	  additional warning switches (not activated by -Wall)
	  to verify all code. Many things that non-gcc
	  compilers could complain about should be fixed in
	  this version.
	* "Video Driver" option not shown if there's only one
	  choice. (Which is the case if you build w/o OpenGL.)
	* Exit with ESCAPE from config menues fixed - now
	  cancels any changes and plays the appropriate sfx.
	* Solaris package building script 'buildpkg.sh' and
	  required configure.in fix by Andreas Spångberg added.
	* String copy bug in cfgparse.cpp fixed. (Andreas
	  Spångberg.)
	* Switching between windowed and fullscreen modes no
	  more results the screen being offset.
	* Screen centering fixed.
	* Border in windowed mode fixed.
	* Cleaned up audio config menu, and added volume
	  controls for sfx, (future) intro music and in-game
	  music. (Note that the "Master Volume" is still
	  there, and it's still digital...)
	* Icreased the number of volume levels available in
	  the audio config menu. (Used to be 25% increments.)
	* Added redefined() and accept() to config_parser_t.
	* Non-interactive widgets handled correctly in menues.
	* Added headers to configuration menues.
	* Added 'unit' string to ct_spin_t.
	* window_t::select() now comes in a private flavor
	  without checks.
	* Config menues now make use of OS_UPDATE_* flags in
	  addition to the OS_CANCEL tag, to allow instant
	  effect controls to cancel/undo properly.
	* config_form_t now has a virtual member undo_hook()
	  that's called by undo(). (Used to make ESC exit work.)
	* Audio engine changes:
		* Channels are separated into voices (mixing)
		  and channels (control abstraction) levels.
		* Groups added for easy channel management.
		* The API provides access to channels and
		  groups, but not direct access to voices.
		* All fixed point values are now 16:16.
		* API variants with float arguments added.
		* AC_DETACH added. (Easy SFX control.)
		* Panning/balance control added.
		* Added "waves" to get rid of sample pointers.
		* AC_SPEED removed. (Obsoleted by the internal
		  conversion to original wave sample rates.)
		* Fixed bug in reverb: Right input missing!
		* Another reverb bug: The delay buffer was too
		  short for >=32000 kHz with the current taps.
		* Implemented AC_RETRIG and AC_RANDTRIG.
		* Improved resampling frequency accuracy.
		* Improved looping accuracy and quality.
		* Added MIDI input implementation for OSS and
		  ALSA raw MIDI interfaces.
		* Fixed potential crash bug; mixing buffer
		  size variable would be wrong if the desired
		  buffer size couldn't be set!
		* Added higher quality voice resamplers.
		* sound.[ch] replaced by a_wave.[ch].
		* Auto trig w/ timeout on the oscilloscope.
		* 8 & 16 bit mono + 16 bit stereo added.
		* Engine code restructured and modularized.
		* "Waveform Construction API" added.
		* Channel->bus->master mixing architecture.
		* FX plugin API added. (Internal, for now.)
		* Reverb LPF cutoff made configurable and
		  independent of the sample rate.
	* Added generic "browsing" API to config_parser_t.
	* Added a copy of LGPL 2.1, and started sorting out
	  which licence applies where. (Basically, the old code
	  is GPL, while most of the new code I've written from
	  scratch is LGPL.)
	* Added window_t::center_token[_fxp]() for nice columns.
	* Started documenting a little...
	* Added "Audio CPU Load" screen for gcc/x86. (Needs
	  high resolution timestamping, and I'm using RDTSC for
	  now.)
	* Added text alignment system for the ct_* widgets, to
	  make use of the new center_token() methods.
	* Various tweaks and adjustments.
	* Credits updated.

Kobo Deluxe v0.4-pre5
	* New versioning rules introduced;
		* Any -preX suffix should *always* be included
		  in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE().
		* No more development snapshots - every package
		  released has a version number of it's own,
		  with a -preX suffix if appropriate.
	* Surface leak when reloading graphics fixed.
	* gfxengine_t::unload() now takes -1 (default) for
	  unloading all banks.
	* gfxengine_t::unload() also destroys SoFont objects!
	* Void pointer arithmetics and some bogus braces fixed.
	  (Thanks, Riki!)
	* Moved sound effects out into files. (Raw format for
	  now, as WAV doesn't support signed 8 bit data...)
	* Minor sound code cleanups.
	* bgmfile.[ch] removed. (Used to be Linux only anyway...)
	* config_parser_t created. (prefs_t is now derived from
	  that class, and contains no parsing code whatsoever.)
	  Also eliminates duplication of "command" decoding for
	  non-config stuff like -showcfg, -debug and -fps.
	* SDL_VIDEOEXPOSE is *finally* at least handled! :-)
	* Removed gcc-only compiler flags and fixed other stuff
	  that caused trouble with some compilers. (Thanks to
	  Andreas Spångberg for the Solaris patch!)
	* Menu and state code cleaned up a little.
	* Configuration menu split up into Video, Audio,
	  Controls and Game.
	* ct_list_t now interprets change(0) (ie button press
	  or similar) as change(1), rather than just ignoring
	  it.

Kobo Deluxe v0.4-pre4
	* Replaced corrupted README.jp.
	* Delayed fps printout to program exit, as some setups
	  have serious trouble with output to the console while
	  running the game.
	* Fixed a sleeping bug in the gl_blendfunc() wrapper.
	* It's now possible to quit gracefully while loading
	  data. (Check when updating the progress bar.)
	* Old style mouse control is back. (Not that I
	  understand how anyone could play with that... :-)
	* Bigger and more visible mouse crosshair.
	* Added 'mouse' switch and 'mousemode' variable to
	  config. (MMD_RELATIVE not yet implemented!)
	* Video config cleaned up - unsupported OpenGL
	  settings removed.
	* Radar window code cleaned up and simplified.
	* window_t::alloc_color renamed to map_rgb, which is
	  more appropriate. The new version takes either three
	  Uint8 components (rather than X style Uint16), or an
	  Uint32 for "HTML style" hex codes.
	* Diagonal rocket sprites lined up with diagonal Kobo
	  (the player's ship! :-) sprites. (The ship has an
	  offset of +1 pixel in y in the gfx)
	* Added missing (8'th) frame to explosion animation.
	* glSDL:
		* Some tiling bugs fixed.
		* Single tile case optimized.
		* Vertical tiling implemented.
		* Horizontal and vertical tiling across multiple
		  textures implemented! (Not both h & v, though.)
		* Off-screen blits are culled.
	* Benchmark results:
	     P-III 933, Matrox G400, XFree86 4.1.0-17mdk:
		Resolution	SDL 2D	glSDL	ratio
		-----------------------------------------------
		1280x1024	16	60	3.8
		960x720		28	102	3.6
		640x480		62	202	3.3
		320x240		227	205	0.9

	  Note that OpenGL is pumping quite a bit more pixels
	  than SDL's RLE blitter in this game, due to the alpha
	  blended window frame. Here are the results with no
	  frame:
	     P-III 933, Matrox G400, XFree86 4.1.0-17mdk:
		Resolution	SDL 2D	glSDL	ratio
		-----------------------------------------------
		1280x1024	18	93	5.2
		960x720		32	163	5.1

	  Notice how glSDL appears to win even more in higher
	  resolutions, while it loses a little to SDL 2D in the
	  low end, where fill rate becomes next to insignificant
	  to OpenGL.

Kobo Deluxe v0.4-pre3
	* Hitting the window close button now causes a "brutal"
	  quit, just like hitting ctrl-C in the console.
	* Mac OS X OpenGL build script fix.
	* Now uses SDL_opengl.h if present. (Dunno if the check
	  is totally portable, though - but if it fail, at least
	  things shouldn't be worse than with the old way.)
	* Implemented tiling of wide surfaces.
		* Does *not* support multiple textures, so it
		  won't help with wide *and* tall surfaces, that
		  simply won't fit in one texture. (Sorry,
		  256x256 people! ;-)
		* The rendering loop for tall surface tiling is
		  missing... (Mostly a matter of cut'n'paste +
		  search'n'replace.)
		* Anyway, this means that Kobo Deluxe now
		  RENDERS PERFECTLY ON OPENGL! :-)

Kobo Deluxe v0.4-pre2
	* The glSDL layer:
		* Now uses handles instead of pointers!
		* Various bugs and stability issues fixed.
		--> Still misses vital features.
		--> Leaks textures - or at least TexInfos.
	* Some double buffer compatibility issues fixed.
	* "Stall" when rebuilding menues fixed.

Kobo Deluxe v0.4-pre1
	* Build with OpenGL on X fixed - without breaking Win32
	  and Mac OS X!
	* Added dummy score file to keep stupid WinZip from
	  removing 'scoredir'...
	* Added README.jp translated by Tsuyoshi Iguchi (?).

	* Upgraded to sfifo-1.2.
	* Various configure script fixes.
	* Added README file.

	* Kobo now tries to save a backup of the user score file
	  in the user's home dir.

	  confirmation dialogs before aborting game or quitting
	  Kobo.
	* Added various eye candy.
	* Added "Options" page.
	* Class myship now releases the player ship object as well
	  when turned off. (myship, and a bunch of other objects,
	  won't be destroyed and re-created when reinitializing.)
	* Moved graphics/ and audio/ from source to include path.
	* Added sound effects to the user interface.
	* Added Mac OS X fixes by Max Horn <max@quendi.de>

	* Plugins added: rgb8, rgba8, cleanalpha, key2alpha, scale
	  and displayformat.
	* Implemented the "size" feature with three different
	  scaling filter modes.
	* Sprite and tile "palettes" separated for correct scaling.
	* Added various "fade out" effects.
	* Added "LOADING" screen.
	* Added "Screen Buffer Mode" setting with single, double,
	  semi triple and half buffering modes. (Note that the game
	  doesn't yet support all of them properly.)
	* Added FPS counter. (-fps switch)
	* Progress bar while loading and converting data.
	* gamestatemanager_t instead of those switch() statements...
	* Added "Get Ready" and "Game Over" states.
	* Improved filemapper_t and score_t portability. (I think...)
	* Removed annoying key state clearing.
	* SoFont:
		* CleanSurface() now only cleans the top row.
		* Fixed rounding when spacer width is odd.
		* No testing of '|' (for cursor) if the font
		  doesn't have it.
	* CS engine:
		* Freeing free objects won't crash the engine.
		* Safer and (probably) faster wrapping code.
	* "width" and "height" replace "size" option.
	* Cleaned up config_form_t and added a "rebuild" action for
	  dynamic configuration panels.
	* Added config options and gfxengine_t::driver(). (No OpenGL
	  code yet. OpenGL options hidden in "options".)
	* Added a thin black border in windowed mode.
	* Proper clipping done by window_t::invalidate() and
	  gfxengine_t::invalidate().
	* Sprite and text calls for fixed point coordinates added.

	* Added contrast and offset parameters to cleanalpha plugin.
	* Audio engine:
		* Added "nearest sample" resampling support.
		* Improved sample looping accuracy.
		* Added "samplerate" option.
		* Random pitch effect on some sound effects.
	* Improved pause mode. (Switches to "get ready".)
	* BTN_FIRE can now be used to start game from intro.
	* Cleanup + fix: SHIPS display is now updated correctly.
	* Added quick hack OpenGL rendering layer. (64 bit broken!)
	* "Escape" in pause mode now sends you to "Abort Game?".
	* Added AdvanceMAME "Scale2x" scaling filter.
	* Gave up on Scale2x + fuzziness factor - it just won't work
	  for 256+ color graphics. (It's still there, though.)
	* Added Diamond2x scaling filter - The Best so far! Also
	  very fast, even without serious optimizations.
	* Various scaling filter bug fixes and cleanups.
	* C++ extension changed from '.C' to '.cpp'.
	* Linux/i586/VGA vidsync hack removed.
	* Added main menu with "Start Game!", "Options" etc.
	* sprite.c: Size check for loading sprite palettes.
	* Added rotating tube effect for menu highlighting.

	* Initial Win32 support:
		* Hacked temporary kludge in score.C
		* Added _snprintf define for snprintf()

SKobo v0.1 update (forgot to mention this...)

	* Added GIMPed framework for the whole screen.
	* Re-implemented the "starfield" by grabbing 64 starry
	  tiles from an XKobo screenshot.

	* Fixed some bugs in sprite.c and cs.c. (*heh*)
	* Added text using the C++ version of SFont; SoFont.
	* Changed audiodev_t to open in nonblocking mode, to avoid the
	  game going to sleep if the device is busy. SKobo disables
	  sound FX if the audio device cannot be opened.
	* Pixeled new font and GIMPed a temorary logo.
	* Added alpha blended frame with rounded corners.
	* Added scrolling background (level 20) in intro mode.
